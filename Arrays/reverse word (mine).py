"""
You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break 
into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, 
but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a function reverse_words() that takes a message as a list of characters and reverses 
the order of the words in place.

Why a list of characters instead of a string?

The goal of this question is to practice manipulating strings in place. 
Since we're modifying the message, we need a mutable â†´ type like a list, 
instead of Python 2.7's immutable strings.

For example:

  message = [ 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', ' ',
            'p', 'o', 'u', 'n', 'd', ' ',
            's', 't', 'e', 'a', 'l' ]

reverse_words(message)

# Prints: 'steal pound cake'
print ''.join(message)

When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, 
and all words are separated by one space.
